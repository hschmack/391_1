# Project 1 for EECS 397: Mobile Computing

This project served as an introduction to Android, as well as using Touch and Sensor data.

## From the Assignment:
In this project, we will learn how to retrieve multiple sensor data from Android phone simultaneously, and how to describe touch movements in terms of an action code and a set of axis values while unlocking a pattern. Pattern lock is one of the greatest way to lock your smart phone and prevent any unwanted key press. However, Smartphones are like mini-computers, but because of that, they are at risk of being hacked and the security problem is always there. Sensors are used in nearly every phone to give it the videogame-like ability to respond to tilt and motion. But mounting research has indicated that it also can be used for all forms of surveillance. Of course, to do this hackers would need to figure out a way to remotely access the sensors and access its data. With these sensor data and touch movement description, hackers can crack your lock pattern easily and get into your smartphone. This means it is necessary for us to know the potential risk and learn the related sensor and motion framework. 

The project consisted of 4 topics
* Generate the Lock Pattern
* Retrieve Touch Data
* Retrieve Sensor Data
* Write Touch and Sensor Data to CSV if the user successfully entered the Lock Pattern
